Tentative Program for Workshop Monday 22 September 2025

Last updated 02 September 2025

## Information

All papers, regardless of type, are currently allocated a 20 minute slot. This is intended to include a few minutes at the end for questions, so please plan for an approximately 15-17 minute presentation using slides.

For papers that include posters, please come to the workshop with your poster. We will hang it in the morning before the first session and leave it up for the duration of the workshop.

For papers that include a demo, you may include demonstration elements during your presentation. We will also have an interactive demo and discussion session in the afternoon for more detailed demonstrations. Ensure your demo has the correct power plug(s) and can accept 240 V 50 Hz AC. 

There is no required format for slides and posters. We recommend slides with 16:9 aspect ratio and a poster of approximately A0 size, and can be oriented either horizontally or vertically.
