title: "The 2025 Workshop on Crystal-Free/-Less Radio and System-based Research for IoT (CrystalFreeIoT 2025)"
---

The CrystalFreeIoT 2025 workshop will bring together researchers and technical experts to share experiences and state-of-the-art research work under crystal-free/-less radio or system integration and thinking in multiple IoT related topics. It will be co-located with [EWSN 2025](https://www.ewsn25.cs.kuleuven.be/) in Leuven, Belgium and held on 22 September 2025.

This is the third in a series after the [first Invited Workshop at Inria Paris](http://parisworkshop.crystalfree.org/) in September 2023 and the [second workshop co-located with CPS-IoT Week](https://crystalfreeiot.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in Hong Kong in May 2024!

We solicit paper submissions with systematic design on topics including, but not limited to:

* System-level Design for IoT (including low-power wireless networking, VLSI, standards-compliant or -compatible protocols, new radio designs, data fusion for multiple-sensor systems)
* Crystal-Free Radio Design and Calibration Techniques
* Wireless Indoor Localization
* Cross IoT-Protocols support
* Swarm Robotics and Behaviors Analysis
* Miniaturization of IoT devices
* Synchronization in Wireless System
* Cryptography for IoT devices (PUF, digital fingerprint, etc.)
* Integrated Backscatter Devices

We also welcome poster submissions in a short-paper format to showcase in-progress research, new problem discussions, or recent results.

## Important Dates

* Workshop Paper Deadline: 01 June 2025 (AoE, 23:59 UTC-12)
* Notification of Paper Acceptance: 15 July 2025
* Camera-Ready Deadline: 18 July 2025

We also invite any presenting authors to register and attend the main EWSN conference which will occur on 23-24 September 2025.

## Submission Instructions

The workshop language is in English. Submitted papers are required to comply with guidelines for ACM conference manuscripts and must not exceed 6 pages in length for papers and 2 pages for short submissions.

[Submission site is hosted on EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=crystalfreeiot2025) and will open soon!
